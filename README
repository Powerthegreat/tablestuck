TO RUN THE TABLESTUCK BOT, YOU FIRST NEED TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS --

1- Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

  When the Node.js installation asks if you want to install tools necessary to compile native modules, please make sure that the box is checked!
  If you don't do this, you will need to install python and Visual Studio c++ manually.

2- Once Node.js is installed, open the command terminal on your computer and type the following --
  npm install discord.js
  npm install enmap
  npm install canvas

3- Put this folder in the same folder as a text file called auth.json and paste the following into it --
  {
    "token": "YOUR DISCORD BOT TOKEN HERE",
    "prefix": ">",
    "admin": "YOUR DISCORD ID HERE"
  }

  The bot has a TOURNAMENT MODE. If client.limit in bot.js is 0, it is disabled, but if it is a number greater than 0, it is enabled.
  If the bot is in TOURNAMENT MODE, auth.json will need an extra section called "list" with a list of discord IDs allowed in your tournament:
  {
    "token": "YOUR DISCORD BOT TOKEN HERE",
    "prefix": ">",
    "admin": "YOUR DISCORD ID HERE",
    "list": [
        "DISCORD ID",
        "DISCORD ID"
    ]
  }

4- Replace the information in the token and admin spaces with your own information to connect this program to your own discord bot

5- Create an empty folder called "data" in the same folder as auth.json

6- Open the file "run.bat" to start the bot

--this code is not the finished version of the bot and will continue to be updated regularly on github--
